1. never write variable(usestate()) in if else also in for loop
   usestate should not be called in outside componenet
2.we can create several useeffects 

3.never create component inside component
4.
  i).createBrowserRouter is use to create configuirations
    of routes
  ii). inside take it array of objects
  iii). give path and element as keys path is for route element is component
  iv). then import routerProvide to render specific rout page
  v) we can take children element and make it as a array and it can be used as a outlet
     outlet == is collecction of childrens element
  vii). also we can make errorElement and render it as a global error.
  vi). Link tag from react router dom can be used as anchor tag
  



Assignments:-
1. What are various ways to add images into our app? 
   explain with code examples
=>Using the full URL of the image for the web (CDN) or any public images. Example :
  <img src="https://reactjs.org/logo-og.png" alt="React Image" /> 
  Adding the image into the project Drag your image into your project and import it into the desired component
  import reactLogo from "./reactLogo.png";
  export default function App() {
   return <img src={reactLogo} alt="react logo" />
    }
   The correct way to structure images in your project is to add them in an images folder.
   If you are using other assets than just images, you might want to add all in the assets folders.

  import reactLogo from "../../assets/images/reactLogo.png";
  export default function App() {
   return <img src={reactLogo} alt="react logo" />
  }


2.what would happen if we do consolw.log(useState())?
=>If we do console.log(useState()), we get an array [undefined, function] 
  where first item in an array is state is undefined and the second item in an array is
  setState function is bound dispatchSetState.


3.How will useEffect behave if we don't add a dependency array ?
=>Syntax of useEffect is:
  useEffect(() => {}, []);
  Case 1 : When the dependency array is not included in the arguments of useEffect() hook,
  the callback function will be executed every time the component is rendered and re-rendered.
  useEffect(() => {
	console.log("I run everytime this component rerenders")
   });
  Case 2 : When the dependency array is empty in the arguments of useEffect() hook,
  the callback function will be executed only one time during the initial render of the component.
  useEffect(() => {
        	console.log("I Only run once (When the component gets mounted)")
   }, []);
   Case 3 : When the dependency array contains a condition,
   the callback function will be executed one time during the initial render of
   the component and also rerender if there is a change in the condition.
   useEffect(() => {
	console.log("I run every-time when my condition changed")
   }, [condition]);


4.What is SPA ?
=>Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that dynamically updates the webpage 
  with data from web server without reloading/refreshing the entire page.
  All the HTML, CSS, JS are retrieved in the initial load and other data/resources can be
  loaded dynamically whenever required. An SPA is sometimes referred to as a single-page interface (SPI).


5.What is difference between Client Side Routing and Server
  Side Routing ?
  In Server-side routing or rendering (SSR), every change in URL,
  http request is made to server to fetch the webpage, and replace the current webpage with the older one.
  In Client-side routing or rendering (CSR), during the first load, the webapp is loaded from server to client,
  after which whenever there is a change in URL, the router library navigates the user to the new page without sending any request to backend.
  All Single Page Applications uses client-side routing.
