element in js  and place them in the dom without any 
createElement() and or appendchild() method JSX makes it easier to write and add
HTML in React. JSX converts HTML tags into react elements

providing you with a superpower to write logic and 
markup of a component inside a single .jsx file. 
JSX is easy to maintain and debug.

3. Role of type attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?
=>A: The type attribute specifies the type of the script. 
The type attribute identifies the content between the 
<script> and </script> tags. It has a Default value which is “text/javascript”.

type attribute can be of the following types:
text/javascript : It is the basic standard of writing javascript code inside the <script> tag.
Syntax
<script type="text/javascript"></script>
text/ecmascript : this value indicates that the script is following the EcmaScript standards.
module: This value tells the browser that the script is a module that can import or export other files or modules inside it.
text/babel : This value indicates that the script is a babel type and required bable to transpile it.
text/typescript: As the name suggest the script is written in TypeScript.

4.{TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX.
=>A: The Difference is stated below:

--{TitleComponent}: This value describes the TitleComponent as a javascript expression or a variable. 
The {} can embed a javascript expression or a variable inside it.
--<TitleComponent/> : This value represents a Component that is basically returning Some JSX value. 
In simple terms TitleComponent a function that is returning a JSX value. A component is written inside the {<  />} expression.
--<TitleComponent></TitleComponent> : <TitleComponent /> 
and <TitleComponent></TitleComponent> are equivalent only when < TitleComponent /> has no child components. 
The opening and closing tags are created to include the child components.
