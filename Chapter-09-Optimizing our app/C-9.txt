Assignments:
1.When and why do we need lazy?
=>Lazy loading (also called on-demand loading) is an optimization technique for the online content, be it a website or a web app.
Instead of loading the entire web page and rendering it to the user in one go as in bulk loading, 
the concept of lazy loading assists in loading only the required section and delays the remaining, until it is needed by the user.
2.What is suspence?
=>While a lazy-loaded component is being loaded, you may want to display a fallback component to the user. 
 This is where the Suspense component comes in. Suspense allows you to specify a fallback component to render while a lazy-loaded component is loading.

3.Why we got this error: A Component suspended while responding to synchronus
  this will cause the UI to be replaced with a loading indicator. To fix
  updates that suspend should be wrapped with startTransition? How does suspense
  fix this error
4.Advantages and disadvatages using this code splitting pattern ?
5.when do we need and why do we need suspense ?

Notes:

1.why hooks imp ?

1.Redeability
2.Reusibility
3.Modularity==>breaken down in meaningful pieces
4.maintainable
5.testable


Custom Hooks ?

1.Hooks are like normal function we use hooks to export some logic into that 
function


2.
=chunking
=code splitting
=lazy loading
=on demand loading
=Dynamic import

lazy loading should always be on the top
