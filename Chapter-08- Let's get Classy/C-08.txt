Notes:-
1.Class Based Componet :-

class Profile extends React.component {
   render(){
	return(
	   <h1>Hello world</h1>
    }
  )
}

const Profile=()=>{
	return(
  <h1>hwllo</h1>	
 )
}


2. props we are acessing in the class component by using this.props
3. how to create state in class based component ?=>
   in class component has constructor
4.constructor is place used for initialization whenever class is invoked
  constructor is called
5.class Profile extends React.component {
   constructor(props){
       super(props)
         this.state = {
           count: 0
	 }
}
   render(){
	return(
	   <h1>Hello world</h1>
    }
  )
}

6.we do not mutate state directly
*react life cycle
7.constructor then render  
8.componenetdidmount =>this is the fucntion after render it will
  get called 
  sequence (constructor, render, componentdidmount)
  we are making api calls in componentdidmount



mounting
render phase--constructor called, render called (fast phase)
commit phase--react is modifying dom componentDidMount called (slow)



1.first research question =>s
why do we do super props ?
what is constructor ?
why do we write props ?	

2.why can't i make useEffect async ?
  and componentDidMount async ?
