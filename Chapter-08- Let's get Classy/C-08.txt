Notes:-
1.Class Based Componet :-

class Profile extends React.component {
   render(){
	return(
	   <h1>Hello world</h1>
    }
  )
}

const Profile=()=>{
	return(
  <h1>hwllo</h1>	
 )
}


2. props we are acessing in the class component by using this.props
3. how to create state in class based component ?=>
   in class component has constructor
4.constructor is place used for initialization whenever class is invoked
  constructor is called
5.class Profile extends React.component {
   constructor(props){
       super(props)
         this.state = {
           count: 0
	 }
}
   render(){
	return(
	   <h1>Hello world</h1>
    }
  )
}

6.we do not mutate state directly
*react life cycle
7.constructor then render  
8.componenetdidmount =>this is the fucntion after render it will
  get called 
  sequence (constructor, render, componentdidmount)
  we are making api calls in componentdidmount



mounting
render phase--constructor called, render called (fast phase)
commit phase--react is modifying dom componentDidMount called (slow)



1.first research question =>s
why do we do super props ?
what is constructor ?
why do we write props ?	

2.why can't i make useEffect async ?
  and componentDidMount async ?


Assignment:-
1.How do you create Nested Routes react-router-dom configuiration?
=>We can create a Nested Routes inside a react router configuration as follows:
 first call createBrowserRouter for routing different pages

const router = createBrowserRouter([
   {
      path: "/", // show path for routing
      element: <Parent />, // show component for particular path
      errorElement: <Error />, // show error component for path is different
      children: [ // show children component for routing
         {
            path: "/path",
            element: <Child />
         }
      ],
   }
])
Now we can create a nested routing for /path using children again as follows:

const router = createBrowserRouter([
   {
      path: "/",
      element: <Parent />,
      errorElement: <Error />,
      children: [
         {
            path: "/path",
            element: <Child />,
            children: [ // nested routing for subchild
               {
                  path: "/child",
                  element: <SubChild />,
               }
            ],
         }
      ],
   }
])



2.Read createHashRouter, createMemoryRouter From React Router docs
=>createHashRouter is useful if you are unable to configure your web server to direct all traffic to your React Router application.
 Instead of using normal URLs, it will use the hash (#) portion of the URL to manage the "application URL".
 Other than that, it is functionally the same as createBrowserRouter. 

 createMemoryRouter Instead of using the browsers history a memory router manages it's own history stack in memory.
 It's primarily useful for testing and component development tools like Storybook,
 but can also be used for running React Router in any non-browser environment.


3.What is the order of life cycle method calls in Class Based Components
=> Following is the order of lifecycle methods calls in Class Based Components:

constructor()
render ()
componentDidMount()
componentDidUpdate()
componentWillUnmount()


4.Why do we use componentDidMount ?
=>The componentDidMount() method allows us to execute the React code when the component is already placed in the DOM (Document Object Model).
 This method is called during the Mounting phase of the React Life-cycle i.e
 after the component is rendered. Wwe can run any piece of react code to modify the components.
 For ex. It's the best place to make API calls.

5.Why do we use componentWillUnmount? Show with example.
=> componentWillUnmount() is useful for the cleanup of the application when we switch routes from one place to another.
 Since we are working with a SPA(Single Page Application) the component process always runs in the background
 even if we switch to another route. So it is required to stop those processes before leaving the page.
 If we revisit the same page, a new process starts that affects the browser performance.
 For example, in Repo class, during componentDidMount() a timer is set with an interval of every one second to print in console.
 When the component is unmounted (users moves to a different page), the timer will be running in the background,
 which we might not even realize and causing huge performance issue. To avoid such situations
 the cleanup function can be done in componentWillUnmount, in this example clearInterval(timer) to clear the timer interval before
 unmounting Repo component.


6.Why do we use super(props) in constructor ?
=>super(props) is used to inherit the properties and access of variables of the React parent class when we initialize our component.
 super() is used inside constructor of a class to derive the parent's all properties inside the class that extended it.
 If super() is not used, then Reference Error : Must call super constructor in derived classes before accessing 'this' or 
 returning from derived constructor is thrown in the console.
 The main difference between super() and super(props) is the this.props is undefined in child's
 constructor in super() but this.props contains the passed props if super(props) is used.



7.(Research) Why can't we have the callback function of UseEffect async ?
=> useEffect expects it's callback function to return nothing or return a function
 (cleanup function that is called when the component is unmounted).
 If we make the callback function as async, it will return a promise and the promise will affect the clean-up function from being called.
